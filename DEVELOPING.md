## How it Works
 
It's a very lightweight wrapper around the java process commands.

## Building

Run `gradle build`.

## Testing

Tests are run automatically as part of `gradle build`, but can also be
explicitly run via `gradle `.

## Releasing

The jar is published when a tag is created in the master branch.
